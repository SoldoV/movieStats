      <h1 class="bio-header my-10">Stanley Kubrick</h1>
      <p>Stanley Kubrick, considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers in American history, was a director cum
        producer known for his innovation in cinematography. A highly creative personality, he worked in a number of
        genres ranging from romance and crime to horror and science fiction. His interest in films stems from his
        childhood when he used to bunk classes to watch movies. He was an intelligent boy but had no passion for
        academic pursuits; in fact his high school grades were so low that he could not get into a decent college! He
        began his career as a photographer and learnt the aspects of cinematography and film production. He directed his
        first film at the age of 23—it was a short documentary about the boxer Walter Cartier. Film making intrigued the
        young Stanley and he tried to learn all he could about the art. He made his initial films on a shoestring
        budget, but his fate took a turn for the better with the release of ‘Spartacus’. The film became a smash hit and
        established Kubrick as a major director. He was fond of innovation; many of his films are credited to have
        introduced new elements in cinematography. He was not someone who shied away from controversy—artistic
        expression was all he cared about, as is evident from the range of topics he chose to film.
